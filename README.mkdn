# NAME

Iterator::Flex - Iterators with flexible behaviors

# VERSION

version 0.12

# SYNOPSIS

# DESCRIPTION

Note! **`Iterator::Flex` is alpha quality software.**

## What is It?

`Iterator::Flex` provides iterators that can:

- rewind to the beginning, keeping track of state (e.g. cycles which
always know the previous value).
- reset to the initial state
- serialize, so that you can restart from where you left off,
- signal exhaustion by returning a sentinel value (e.g. `undef`) or throwing
an exception, and provide a test for exhaustion via the `is_exhausted` method.
- wrap existing iterators so that they have the same exhaustion interface
as your own iterators
- provide history via `prev` and `current` methods.

These are _optional_ things behaviors that an iterator can support.  Not all
iterators need the bells and whistles, but sometimes they are very handy.

## Where are the iterators?

See [Iterator::Flex::Common](https://metacpan.org/pod/Iterator%3A%3AFlex%3A%3ACommon) for a set of common iterators.  These
are premade for you.  See [Iterator::Flex::Manual::Using](https://metacpan.org/pod/Iterator%3A%3AFlex%3A%3AManual%3A%3AUsing) for how to
use them.

## I need to write my own.

See [Iterator::Flex::Manual::Authoring](https://metacpan.org/pod/Iterator%3A%3AFlex%3A%3AManual%3A%3AAuthoring) for how to write your own
flexible iterators.

See [Iterator::Flex::Manual::Internals](https://metacpan.org/pod/Iterator%3A%3AFlex%3A%3AManual%3A%3AInternals) for how everything links
together.
