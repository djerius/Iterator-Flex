  [BUG FIX]

    * method for detecting existing method roles was broken


0.05      2018-05-07 12:21:27-04:00 America/New_York

0.04      2018-05-04 17:21:15-04:00 America/New_York

  [BUG FIXES]

    * ifreeze properly handles exhausted predicates

      support a method.

    * more optimization; should make things faster (by some unknown amount)

0.03      2018-01-16 13:27:23-05:00 America/New_York

      borken.

0.02      2018-01-16 13:27:23-05:00 America/New_York

  [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    * new iterator functions: ifreeze, icache
    * new ':all' export tag
    * add support for current() method
    * new spec on what prev/current/next return as function of iterator state


  [ BUG FIXES ]


    * iproduct needs dependent iterators to have memory of last and
      current values when freezing.  rewind() is renamed to reset(),
      and new rewind retains current/prev values.

    * iterator states were always set to <active> when next was called.
      now the state is updated to <active> only if it was <inactive>.


0.01      2018-01-05 16:36:29-05:00 America/New_York

* First release upon an unsuspecting world.
