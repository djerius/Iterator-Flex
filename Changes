  [ ENHANCEMENTS ]

    * new iterator functions: ifreeze, icache
    * new ':all' export tag
    * add support for current() method
    * new spec on what prev/current/next return as function of iterator state


  [ BUG FIXES ]


    * iproduct needs dependent iterators to have memory of last and
      current values when freezing.  rewind() is renamed to reset(),
      and new rewind retains current/prev values.

    * iterator states were always set to <active> when next was called.
      now the state is updated to <active> only if it was <inactive>.
