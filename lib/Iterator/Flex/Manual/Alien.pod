# PODNAME: Iterator::Flex::Manual::Alien
# ABSTRACT: Interfacing with non- Iterator::Flex things.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Iterator::Flex> provides transparent access to iterators available
on CPAN (see L<Iterator::Flex::Manual::PriorArt>), as well as things
which are L<iterable|Iterator::Flex::Manual::Glossary/iterable thing>,
such as arrays (or objects which act like arrays), or globrefs (or
objects which act like them), or objects which provide iterator
methods.

For these, L<Iterator::Flex::Common/iter> is the
family-friendly front end; L<under the hood|/UNDER THE HOOD>
L<Iterator::Flex::Factory/construct_from_iterable> does the heavy
lifting.

There's also L<Iterator::Flex::ArrayLike>, which interfaces
to objects which can provide a length and an element accessor.


=head1 UNDER THE HOOD

=head2 Other iterators

Interfacing is accomplished by creating a proxy iterator which translates

=over

=item 1

Invocation

=item 2

Exhaustion signalling

=back

and forwards other capability invocations to the source iterator.


=head2 Invocation

Some iterators are objects which are invoked via a method call, others
are code references which can be called directly. L<Iterator::Flex> always
works with code references, so in the former case, a closure must be
created.
