=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Object

An iterator is an object.  It is composed from a base class
(L<Iterator::Flex::Base>) and a number of roles.  (Some iterators use
a subclass of L<Iterator::Flex::Base>, but they should be rewritten as
roles.)

The object is a blessed code reference (not a hash).  This allows the
iterator to be called without method lookup overhead:

  $iter = iterator { ... };
  $value = $iter->();

The roles incorporate optional capabilities or different ways of implementing
a behavior (e.g., signalling exhaustion via throwing an exception versus returning
a sentinel).  They are also used to implement interfaces to alien iterators.

=head2 Object Attributes

Storage for object attributes is done via the "inside-out" object model.  Attributes
are stored in the C<%Iterator::Flex::Utils::Registry> hash, keyed off of the internal
memory address of the object obtained via L<Scalar::Util/refaddr>.
The entry in the registry is deleted upon object destruction.

Each registry entry is a hash, with the following structure (constants
for the keys are available from L<Iterator::Flex::Utils>):

  $Registry{ref address}
    + -- { +ITERATOR }
         + -- { +CURRENT }
         + -- { +METHODS }
         + -- { +NEXT }
         + -- { +PREV }
         + -- { +RESET }
         + -- { +REWIND }
         + -- { +STATE }
         + -- { +_DEPENDS }
         + -- { +_NAME }
    + -- { +GENERAL }
         + -- { +INPUT_EXHAUSTION }
         + -- { +EXHAUSTION }
         + -- { +ERROR }

=head2 Object Construction

There are two steps to object construction:

=item 1

Class construction

=item 2

Object iteration

=back

=head3 Class Construction

Classes can be constructed using the
L<factory|Iterator::Flex::Factory> or via L<Iterator::Flex::Base> or a
subclass thereof.

The fundamental constructor is
C<Iterator::Flex::Base::new_from_attrs>.  Everything else calls it. It
accepts two hash arguments, one for parameters specific to the
particular iterator, the other for specifyin general behaviors, such
as how the iterator should signal exhaustion or error.
