::Base is more than a base class. It adds methods like construct and to_iterator which don't belong in a base class.
Investigate serializing Sub::Quote routines
update documentation for Base->construct_from_object and construct_from_iterable
add iterator which provides access to the next-in-line iterator
add tests for throwing, as it looks like some classes don't include the Failure class
choose throw/flag exhaustion behavior at iterator construction time
current roles such as Throw add functionality. need versions that define interface, so that iterators which inherently throw can declare the interface

add role for boolean overload if iterator can detect if it will produce additional values.
